We have began focusing on "I can manage content using established workflows", since tasks have been assigned we will meet on Sunday to begin managing the workflow. We will outline the websites design, implement weekly research of events on campus, and having the skeletal structure of the site finished within the next week. There will be a set deadline for everything we want to accomplish in order to keep us on track.
