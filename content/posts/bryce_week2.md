In my first 2 weeks of this class I would already say that I am making progress toward a few of the I can statements. The first two are the two I would say I'm learning the most. 
In the lecture I took from it that there are two defining characteristics of content. These two according to Barker, content is information created by editorial process and intended for consumption by a human audience. 
In our groups we are working with Hugo and Github, I can descirbe these two platforms pretty well as content management systems.
Overall, going into week 3 i feel good where I am at.
