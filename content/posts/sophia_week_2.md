I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. This week has allowed me to learn how to manage the back end of the Hugo website and edit content using website with listed wordpress commands.

Update:
Dr.Greenhalgh Q&A
Thanks for sharing! Can you say more about how this fits with resources for self-directed learning? That is, what resources did you use to direct your learning in this direction?

There are many different platforms that people can use to share their knowledge and also expanding others insight while doing so. There are many times that we have to find knowledge through outside platforms when we run into issues outside of class. The sight that helped me solve my issue is called XPEXPLORER, I'll link the article bellow. This was immensly useful because it gave me a better understanding of how coding can be altered when working with multiple systems at one time.
