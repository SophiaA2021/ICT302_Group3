Because this week was so short and I was sick during the end I'll continue expanding my insight on last weeks I can statement. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. Except this week instead of being the one seaking answers my group memebers were looking to me for answers. On specifically how to use Github to create their posts and how to edit the format to fit their needs. This included title editing, time stamp changes, and file nameing. So we had a little review and discussion on working with Github and how this format would work well to start our student event board.
