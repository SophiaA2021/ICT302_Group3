I can manage content using established workflows. This week I was able to create an extra post the wordpress site. 

My part of the group report

what weâ€™ve accomplished:
we've decied the theme/colors etc for our wordpress site and now were starting to add content. We also were able to create extra post for the site so thats good. 

What is going well:
i think things are going slowly but surely. personally it's hard for to to do any really extensive work because I've never used wordpress before but i guess i'm understanding it more as time goes on.

What is not going well: 
I think things are going well but thats just me. 

Next steps:
Start adding the bulk of site in order to get it done.
