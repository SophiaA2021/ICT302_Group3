After we assigned roles this week we can start focusing on "I can manage content using established workflows", once we begin the process of assigning tasks this coming week we will begin the workflow prcess to manage the content on the website. This will look like editing the website design, begin the content collection, and implementation of both for the next two weeks. Maybe more time since not everyone is used to the posting system yet.
