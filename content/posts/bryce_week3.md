After the 3rd week, I am continuing to develop my skills within this course at a steady pace. I can identify and define key concepts in content management, this week we focused on content and commerce in lecture. I can compare and describe content management systems such as Github that we are using for our group report. I can somehwat identify and employ technologies related to content management. The other two I can statements are a work in progress!
